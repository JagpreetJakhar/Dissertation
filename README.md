# Neural ODEs for Physical Systems

This repository contains the code and resources for an MSc dissertation exploring the application of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) to model complex physical systems. The study focuses on three distinct physical systems: **the double pendulum, the Lorenz attractor, and the magnetic domain wall problem.** The objective is to investigate and compare the predictive performance of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Neural ODEs.

## Key Concepts

- **Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs)**: A neural network architecture that parameterizes the derivative of a system's state, enabling continuous-time modeling with ODE solvers.

- **Chaotic Systems**: Dynamical systems with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, such as the double pendulum and the Lorenz attractor.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Sequential models using hidden states to maintain memory over time.
- **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)**: Enhanced RNNs that use gating mechanisms to overcome vanishing gradient issues.
- **Adjoint Method**: An efficient backpropagation method for Neural ODEs that saves memory and ensures numerical stability.
- **ODE Solvers**: Numerical methods like Eulerâ€™s method, RK4, and Dormand-Prince (DOPRI5) to approximate ODE solutions.

**Key Observations:**
- Neural ODEs outperform RNNs and LSTMs in modeling long-term dynamics, preserving system behavior better.
- NODEs struggle with:
  - Systems with abrupt changes (e.g., magnetic domain wall dynamics).
  - Stiff ODEs and chaotic systems over extended timeframes.

## Future Work

### Proposed Directions:
1. **Augmented Neural ODEs (ANODEs):** Improve NODEs by increasing the dimensions of the state space.
2. **Second-Order Neural ODEs (SONODEs):** Better suited for systems with inherent second-order dynamics.
3. **Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs):** Enforce conservation laws for physical interpretability.
4. **Lagrangian Neural Networks:** Use Lagrangian mechanics for energy conservation in modeling chaotic systems.
